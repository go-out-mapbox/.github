<h1><b>Going the other way than usual</b></h1>
<p>Mostly I take the same way. I started to doubt that.</p>
<p>
  Reasons why I take the same way<br/>
  - because probably the shortest route<br/>
  - because I have somewhere I want to drop at on the way<br/>
  - because narrow ways make me nervous<br/>
  - less traffic lights. less passengers. main road - bright, flat, wide, comfortable<br/>
  - etc.
</p>
<p>
  I realized I had many reasons.<br/>
  However, I can't answer if asked why did I decide the way I always take was the best one.
</p>
<p>
  Even if I was in a hurry and took the shortest way. It hasn't proved that the way is the shortest because I don't know other ways much.<br/>
  Adding to say that, I'm not always in a hurry and I don't much care about taking the shortest way.<br/>
  Still I have almost NEVER turned left if the destination is on my right side.
</p>
<p>
  This was such a shocking realization. This made me realize that the way I always take isn't the best way. Also, the realization gave me infinite choices.<br/>
  From now, for a while, I don' t need to take the way I always take. But if I pay less attention I easily take the same way again.
</p>
<p>
  Today I concentrated on that and took the other ways.
</p>
<p>
  Note: Not completely sure but the way I took today were not the best.<br/>
  But, it felt so much better taking the other ways than the way I had taken all the time.
